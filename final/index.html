            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This project explores the simulation of paper-like materials through cloth simulation techniques, focusing on achieving realistic folding and bending behaviors. Building upon the CS 184 Project 4 cloth simulation framework, we implemented a more robust physics engine based on implicit integration and enhanced constraint modeling. We replaced the rectangular grid structure with support for arbitrary triangle meshes loaded from OBJ files, and introduced specialized forces to approximate paper stiffness and bending resistance. While we initially planned to implement full origami folding capabilities, we strategically narrowed our scope to focus on the underlying physics of paper-like materials. Our approach successfully demonstrates that cloth simulation techniques can be adapted to model stiffer materials with realistic folding behavior without implementing complex remeshing or explicit fold creation.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>After looking through the paper we planned to use in the proposal (<i>Folding and Crumpling of Adaptive Sheets</i>), we realized that the complexity of the paper was too high for us to reasonably complete the project within the 4-week timeframe. So, we spent some time finding an alternate, simpler implementation of paper simulation: <i>Discrete Shells Origami</i>. This paper required us to first implement a new cloth simulation/mesh framework outlined in another paper: <i>Large Steps in Cloth Simulation</i>. We decided to use our finished CS 184 Project 4 code as a base for our project, but with the following changes:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>We added a system to load meshes from <code>.obj</code> files rather than simply having rectangular cloth. This also naturally resulted in the arrangement of springs being different from the Project 4 code. Instead of each spring being represented as a 3D line segment in our mesh, the springs are now not separate entities from the triangles, but rather, each triangle has its own constants for shearing, bending, and stretching forces.</li>
                
                <li>We changed the integrator from using Verlet integration to using the implicit integrator outlined in the <i>Large Steps in Cloth Simulation</i> paper. This integrator utilizes the below formula for calculating the next position and velocity of our point masses.
                \[\begin{bmatrix}\Delta\vec{x}\\\Delta\vec{v}\end{bmatrix}=h\begin{bmatrix}\vec{v}_t+\Delta\vec{v}\\\mathbf{M}^{-1}\vec{f}\left(\vec{x}_t+\Delta\vec{x},\vec{v}_t+\Delta\vec{v}\right)\end{bmatrix}\]
                where \(\vec{f}(\cdot,\cdot)\) is the force vector at a given position and velocity, \(\mathbf{M}\) is a matrix that maps an acceleration vector to a net force vector applied to the point mass, \(t\) represents our current timestep, and \(t+h\) represents the next timestep. Another key benefit of this simulation technique is that it runs faster than typical explicit integrators (this result is outlined in the paper).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>So far, we have implemented stretch and shearing constraint springs in our mesh, but have yet to handle bending constraints. In order to begin working on simulating paper, we need to implement the bending constraints.</p>

            <p>To be more specific, here are the changes we made to the Project 4 code:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We added a function <code>buildFromOBJ()</code> to <code>cloth.cpp</code> to load an arbitrary <code>.obj</code> file and place point masses according to the file's mesh structure.</li>
                <li>We created the new files <code>physics.cpp</code> and <code>physics.h</code> that calculate stretch constraints and shearing constraints for each triangle in our mesh. The implementation is outlined in the <i>Large Steps in Cloth Simulation</i> paper.</li>
                <li>We changed <code>buildClothMesh()</code> in <code>cloth.cpp</code> to build our cloth mesh according to the mesh constructed by <code>buildFromOBJ()</code>. In this function, we also constructed a world-to-object space matrix \(\mathbf{D}_{u,v}\) for each triangle, which we use in our stretch and shear constraint calculations.</li>
            </ul>
        </section> -->

        <section id="technical-approach">
            <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
            <p>Our project set out to simulate realistic paper behavior by buliding upon the cloth-based framework. We were initially drawn to the complexity and richness of <i>Folding and Crumpling of Adaptive Sheets</i>, but its nonlinear modeling and intricate remeshing made it unsuitable for our 4-week timeline. Instead, we chose to build on two well-established resources: <i>Large Steps in Cloth Simulation</i> by Baraff and Witkin and <i>Discrete Shells Origami</i> by Burgoon et al.</p>

            <p>Rather than implementing a full paper-folding or origami simulator (which would require dynamic mesh updates and user-directed fold paths), our goal was to simulate a paper-like material—rigid yet flexible enough to bend and form folds—by extending our existing CS 184 Project 4 cloth simulation with more advanced force models and mesh support.</p>

            <h3>0. Establishing a Solid Foundation</h3>
            <p>Before diving into paper simulation, we first ensured we had a robust and correct cloth simulation as our foundation. We combined our individual Project 4 implementations, carefully fact-checking and validating every aspect of the physics engine. This involved testing each force calculation, constraint satisfaction, and integration step against known examples to ensure numerical stability and physical accuracy. We spent significant time debugging edge cases and optimizing the core simulation loop, as we recognized that any inaccuracies in the base cloth implementation would be amplified when attempting to model the stiffer and more complex behavior of paper. This thorough verification process gave us confidence in our baseline before attempting to extend it with more sophisticated models.</p>

            <h3>1. Triangle Mesh Support and OBJ Loading</h3>
            <p>We began by replacing the rectangular grid cloth structure in our Project 4 codebase with a general mesh system capable of loading arbitrary triangular meshes from .obj files. We implemented a comprehensive <code>buildFromOBJ()</code> function in <code>cloth.cpp</code> which leverages the TinyOBJ library to parse input files and construct a coherent simulation model. The function extracts vertex positions, face connectivity, and texture coordinates (UVs) from the OBJ file and maps them to our internal data structures.</p>

            <p>For each triangle in the mesh, we construct a material-space parameterization matrix \(D_{uv}\) and its inverse \(D_{uv}^{-1}\), which relates texture-space coordinates to 3D positions. This mapping is critical for accurate physics simulation as it allows us to compute strain tensors that preserve the original material properties. The core relationship is defined by:</p>

            <p class="formula">
                \[(x_2 - x_1 \quad x_3 - x_1) = \begin{pmatrix} u_2 - u_1 & u_3 - u_1 \\ v_2 - v_1 & v_3 - v_1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} w_u \\ w_v \end{pmatrix}\]
            </p>

            <p>Where \((u_i, v_i)\) are texture coordinates, \(x_i\) are 3D positions, and \(w_u\) and \(w_v\) are the deformation vectors that capture how the material stretches and shears. This formulation enables us to simulate more complex shapes with physically accurate folding and bending behaviors, which are essential for realistic cloth simulation.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The mesh system is complemented by a half-edge data structure that efficiently tracks adjacency information between triangles, enabling us to model bending forces between non-adjacent vertices across shared edges. This representation provides the topological foundation needed for simulating the complex mechanical behaviors of cloth, particularly its resistance to folding.</p>

            <h3>2. Physics Engine Upgrade: Implicit Integration and Constraint Modeling</h3>
            <p>To support stiffer, more realistic materials, we transitioned from explicit Verlet integration to the implicit backward Euler integration described in <i>Large Steps in Cloth Simulation</i> [1]. The core formulation involves solving for position and velocity at the next time step using:</p>

            <p class="formula">
                \[\begin{bmatrix}\Delta\vec{x}\\\Delta\vec{v}\end{bmatrix}=h\begin{bmatrix}\vec{v}_t+\Delta\vec{v}\\\mathbf{M}^{-1}\vec{f}\left(\vec{x}_t+\Delta\vec{x},\vec{v}_t+\Delta\vec{v}\right)\end{bmatrix}\]
            </p>

            <p>Our implementation uses significantly higher stiffness coefficients (<code>k_stretch = 1e4</code> and <code>k_shear = 1e4</code>) compared to our previous explicit solver, which would have been unstable with such values. The force computations use analytical gradient calculations to capture both direction and magnitude of deformation accurately. For stretch forces, we compute constraint vectors based on the difference between current and rest state lengths:</p>

            <p class="formula">
                \[C(\mathbf{x})=A_{uv}\cdot(||w_u||-1,||w_v||-1)\]
            </p>

            <p>where \(w_u\) and \(w_v\) are the deformation vectors derived from the world-to-material space transformation using the \(\mathbf{D}_{u,v}^{-1}\) matrix:</p>

            <p class="formula">
                \[\begin{pmatrix}w_u\\w_v\end{pmatrix}=\mathbf{D}_{u,v}^{-1}\begin{pmatrix}x_2-x_1\\x_3-x_1\end{pmatrix}\]
            </p>

            <p>This formulation enables per-triangle stretch and shear constraint forces to be computed precisely through the chain rule, with force gradients that feed directly into the implicit solver. For bending resistance, we implemented distance-based constraints between non-adjacent vertices across shared edges, using rest length as reference. These enhancements proved essential for approximating the rigidity of paper, particularly during folding operations where the material must maintain its structure while deforming along crease lines.</p>

            <h3>3. Simulating Paper-Like Bending</h3>
            <p>To mimic the distinctive bending behavior of paper folding and creasing, we implemented a distance-based bending constraint system between non-adjacent vertices in adjacent triangles. Our approach differs from the standard cloth simulation techniques by using significantly higher bending stiffness coefficients (<code>k_bending = 5</code>) and leveraging our half-edge data structure to identify geometrically important vertex pairs.</p>

            <p>The core bending mechanism operates through the <code>bend_update()</code> function, which applies forces between opposing vertices in adjacent triangles sharing an edge. For each edge in our mesh, we identify the opposing vertices that form a "hinge" when the edge becomes a fold.</p>

            <p>Our implementation models the bending energy between these vertices as:</p>

            <p class="formula">
                \[E_b(a,b)=\frac{1}{2}k_b \cdot \max(0, d_{rest} - d_{cur})^2\]
            </p>

            <p>Where \(d_{rest}\) is the initial distance between vertices and \(d_{cur}\) is their current distance. This energy formulation generates restoration forces that preserve the rest-state distance between vertices:</p>

            <p class="formula">
                \[\vec{F}_a = k_b \cdot \max(0, d_{rest} - d_{cur}) \cdot \frac{\vec{x}_a - \vec{x}_b}{||\vec{x}_a - \vec{x}_b||}\]
            </p>

            <p>While we did not implement the full discrete shell formulation described in [2], which would involve dihedral angle-based bending energies, our approach efficiently approximates paper-like behavior. The direct vertex-to-vertex springs effectively resist angular deviation between triangle pairs, creating a bending resistance profile similar to that of paper.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Additionally, we explored extending the bending constraint network to include "3-separated" vertices (commented in our code), which would provide additional rigidity for sharper folds. Though we didn't implement dynamic mesh modifications such as adaptive remeshing along fold lines, our approach effectively simulates folding behavior through the combination of high-stiffness stretch constraints and strategically placed bending forces between well-chosen vertex pairs.</p>

            <h3>4. Experimental Creasing (Partial)</h3>
            <p>As part of our exploration into folding, we began experimenting with plastic deformation effects by considering potential modifications to the <code>bend_update()</code> function. Our approach draws inspiration from the folding mechanism in Discrete Shells Origami [2], where "rest angles" between triangle pairs are incrementally updated to simulate permanent creases.</p>

            <p>Currently, our bend constraint uses a fixed rest distance defined at initialization. To implement true creasing, we would need to selectively modify these rest distances between specific vertex pairs to create persistent fold lines. We theorized that by gradually interpolating these rest states—rather than making sudden changes that could cause instability—we could achieve more natural-looking folds.</p>

            <p>This approach would allow the simulation to "remember" fold lines by making gradual adjustments to the rest state geometry. However, we did not complete a full implementation of plastic folding or tracking persistent deformation across folds in the current version. The half-edge data structure we've established provides the topological foundation needed for this extension in future work.</p>

            <h3>Problems Encountered</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Omission of Shear Constraints Led to Distortion</strong>
                    <p>Initially, we believed triangle meshes would resist shearing due to their angular rigidity. In practice, omitting shear constraints resulted in non-physical distortion. We corrected this by implementing triangle-local shear forces based on the deformation gradient.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Performance Challenges with High Stiffness</strong>
                    <p>Simulating paper realistically required very high stiffness values, especially for bending. This in turn made the solver slow, requiring hundreds of steps per frame. We addressed this using damping and experimented with reduced stiffness values to strike a balance between speed and realism.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unstable Folding Without Gradual Updates</strong>
                    <p>Sharp changes to bending rest angles caused the mesh to oscillate or break. Inspired by [2], we introduced time-based interpolation of rest angles to fold gradually, improving stability.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shear Forces Are Not Optional in Triangle Meshes</strong>
                    <p>Even with a well-structured mesh, realistic deformation requires explicit modeling of both stretching and shearing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Implicit Integration Enables Realistic Stiffness</strong>
                    <p>While more computationally expensive, implicit methods allow for higher fidelity in simulating stiff materials like paper. The tradeoff between accuracy and performance must be tuned carefully.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gradual Rest-State Modification Prevents Instability</strong>
                    <p>Trying to force a mesh into a folded state too quickly results in instability. Progressive rest-state updates are essential for simulating fold-like behavior.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Paper Simulation is Achievable Without Full Origami Modeling</strong>
                    <p>Although we did not implement interactive folding or edge remeshing, we achieved realistic folding effects through force-based simulation alone, showing that a simplified paper model can still produce meaningful visual results.</p>
