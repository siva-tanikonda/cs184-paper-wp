            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p> This project explores the simulation of paper-like materials through cloth simulation techniques, focusing on achieving realistic folding and bending behaviors. Building upon the CS 184 Project 4 cloth simulation framework, we implemented a robust physics engine that addresses key stability challenges in material simulation. We replaced the rectangular grid structure with support for arbitrary triangle meshes loaded from OBJ files, and introduced specialized forces to approximate paper stiffness and bending resistance. To overcome stability issues with explicit Verlet integration, we implemented a semi-implicit Euler solver with TinyAD for automatic differentiation, enabling efficient computation of derivatives and Hessians for our constraint system. We enhanced realism through angle-based bending constraints and plastic deformation modeling. While we initially planned to implement full origami folding capabilities, we strategically narrowed our scope to focus on the underlying physics of paper-like materials. Our approach successfully demonstrates that cloth simulation techniques can be adapted to model stiffer materials with realistic folding behavior without implementing complex remeshing or explicit fold creation.</p>

            <h2>Technical Approach</h2>

            <p>Our project set out to simulate realistic paper behavior by building upon a cloth-based simulation framework. While we were initially inspired by the complexity and richness of the "Folding and Crumpling of Adaptive Sheets" paper, its highly nonlinear modeling and intricate remeshing requirements proved impractical for our four-week timeline. Instead, we grounded our approach in two well-established resources: "Large Steps in Cloth Simulation" by Baraff and Witkin, and "Discrete Shells Origami" by Burgoon et al. Rather than implementing a full paper-folding or origami simulator—which would require dynamic mesh updates and user-directed fold paths—we focused on simulating the essential physical properties of paper: a material that is rigid yet flexible enough to bend and form creases. To achieve this, we extended our CS 184 Project 4 cloth simulation with support for arbitrary triangle meshes, more advanced force and constraint models, and improved numerical stability, enabling us to capture the unique behaviors of paper-like materials.</p>

            <h3>0. Establishing a Solid Foundation</h3>
            <p>Before diving into paper simulation, we first ensured we had a robust and correct cloth simulation as our foundation. We combined our individual Project 4 implementations, carefully fact-checking and validating every aspect of the physics engine. This involved testing each force calculation, constraint satisfaction, and integration step against known examples to ensure numerical stability and physical accuracy. We spent significant time debugging edge cases and optimizing the core simulation loop, as we recognized that any inaccuracies in the base cloth implementation would be amplified when attempting to model the stiffer and more complex behavior of paper. This thorough verification process gave us confidence in our baseline before attempting to extend it with more sophisticated models.</p>

            <h3>1. Triangle Mesh Support and OBJ Loading</h3>
            <p>We began by replacing the rectangular grid cloth structure in our Project 4 codebase with a general mesh system capable of loading arbitrary triangular meshes from .obj files. We implemented a comprehensive buildFromOBJ() function in cloth.cpp, leveraging the TinyOBJ library to parse input files and construct a coherent simulation model. This function extracts vertex positions, face connectivity, and texture coordinates (UVs) from the OBJ file and maps them to our internal data structures.</p>

            <p>For each triangle in the mesh, we construct a material-space parameterization matrix \(D_{uv}\) and its inverse \(D_{uv}^{-1}\), which relate texture-space coordinates to 3D positions. This mapping is critical for accurate physics simulation, as it allows us to compute deformation gradients and strain tensors that preserve the original material properties. The core relationship is defined by:</p>

            <p class="formula">
                \[(x_2 - x_1 \quad x_3 - x_1) = \begin{pmatrix} u_2 - u_1 & u_3 - u_1 \\ v_2 - v_1 & v_3 - v_1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} w_u \\ w_v \end{pmatrix}\]
            </p>

            <p>Where \((u_i, v_i)\) are texture coordinates, \(x_i\) are 3D positions, and \(w_u\) and \(w_v\) are the 3D directions corresponding to the local \((u, v)\) axes in material space. This formulation enables us to simulate more complex shapes with physically accurate folding and bending behaviors, which are essential for realistic cloth simulation.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The mesh system is complemented by a half-edge data structure that efficiently tracks adjacency information between triangles, enabling us to model bending forces between non-adjacent vertices across shared edges. This representation provides the topological foundation needed for simulating the complex mechanical behaviors of cloth, particularly its resistance to folding.</p>

            <h3>2. Implementing Stiffer Constraints for Paper-Like Behavior</h3>
            <p>
                To accurately capture the rigidity and resistance to stretching and bending that characterize paper, we extended our simulation with much stiffer physical constraints, drawing on techniques from "Large Steps in Cloth Simulation" by Baraff and Witkin. We increased the stiffness parameters for both stretching and shearing forces, making the material far less prone to deformation under load. Additionally, we introduced bending constraints based on the dihedral angles between adjacent triangles, penalizing deviations from the rest configuration to resist unwanted flexing. By carefully tuning these parameters, our system can represent materials that are significantly less flexible than traditional cloth, allowing sharp folds and creases to emerge naturally. This enables the simulation to reproduce the unique mechanical properties of paper, such as its ability to hold shape and form crisp bends, without the need for complex remeshing or explicit fold tracking.
            </p>

            <h3>3. Limitations of Explicit Verlet Integration</h3>
            <p>
                To support stiffer, more realistic materials, we transitioned from explicit Verlet integration to an implicit backward Euler integration scheme, as described in <i>Large Steps in Cloth Simulation</i> [1]. The core formulation involves solving for position and velocity at the next time step by implicitly integrating the forces, which allows for much larger stiffness values without numerical instability. The update step can be summarized as:
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                \[
                \begin{bmatrix}
                \Delta\vec{x} \\
                \Delta\vec{v}
                \end{bmatrix}
                = h
                \begin{bmatrix}
                \vec{v}_t + \Delta\vec{v} \\
                \mathbf{M}^{-1}\vec{f}\left(\vec{x}_t+\Delta\vec{x}, \vec{v}_t+\Delta\vec{v}\right)
                \end{bmatrix}
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                where \(h\) is the timestep, \(\mathbf{M}\) is the mass matrix, and \(\vec{f}\) is the force vector derived from the energy gradients.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our implementation uses significantly higher stiffness coefficients (\(k_\text{stretch} = 1.5 \times 10^5\) and \(k_\text{shear} = 1.5 \times 10^5\)) compared to what would be possible with an explicit solver, which would become unstable for such values. By leveraging automatic differentiation, we compute analytical gradients and Hessians of the energy, enabling the implicit solver to accurately capture both the direction and magnitude of deformations.
            </p>
            <p>
                For stretch forces, we compute constraint vectors based on the difference between the current and rest state edge lengths for each triangle:
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                \[
                C(\mathbf{x}) = A_{uv} \cdot (||\mathbf{w}_u|| - 1,\, ||\mathbf{w}_v|| - 1)
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                where \(\mathbf{w}_u\) and \(\mathbf{w}_v\) are the deformation vectors in 3D, derived from the world-to-material space transformation using the inverse UV parameterization matrix:
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                \[
                \begin{pmatrix}
                \mathbf{w}_u \\
                \mathbf{w}_v
                \end{pmatrix}
                = \mathbf{D}_{uv}^{-1}
                \begin{pmatrix}
                \mathbf{x}_2 - \mathbf{x}_1 \\
                \mathbf{x}_3 - \mathbf{x}_1
                \end{pmatrix}
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                This formulation enables per-triangle stretch and shear constraint forces to be computed precisely, with their gradients feeding directly into the implicit solver. For bending resistance, we use constraints based on the dihedral angle between adjacent triangles, penalizing deviations from the rest angle to model the rigidity of paper. These enhancements are essential for simulating the sharp folds and structural integrity of paper, especially during folding operations where the material must maintain its shape while deforming along crease lines.

            <h3>4. Automatic Differentiation with TinyAD</h3>
            <p>
                To efficiently and accurately compute the gradients and Hessians required for implicit integration, we integrated the TinyAD automatic differentiation library into our simulation pipeline. TinyAD allows us to define the total energy of the system as a sum of per-element energy terms (stretching, shearing, and bending), and then automatically computes the first and second derivatives with respect to all vertex positions. This is crucial for the implicit solver, which requires both the gradient (force) and the Hessian (stiffness matrix) of the energy function at each time step.
            </p>
            <p>
                The total energy of the system is defined as:
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                \[
                E(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{\text{elements}} E_{\text{stretch/shear}}(\mathbf{x}) + \sum_{\text{edges}} E_{\text{bend}}(\mathbf{x}) + \sum_i E_{\text{gravity}}(\mathbf{x}_i)
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                At each simulation step, TinyAD is used to compute:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <strong>gradient</strong> of the energy, \(\nabla E(\mathbf{x})\), which gives the force vector.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The <strong>Hessian</strong> of the energy, \(\nabla^2 E(\mathbf{x})\), which gives the stiffness matrix.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These derivatives are then used in the implicit Euler integration scheme to solve for the updated positions and velocities:
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                \[
                \mathbf{M} \Delta \vec{v} = -\nabla E(\mathbf{x}) - h \nabla^2 E(\mathbf{x}) \Delta \vec{v}
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                By leveraging TinyAD, we avoid the need for manual and error-prone derivative calculations, enabling robust and efficient simulation of highly stiff, paper-like materials.

            <h3>5. Constraint Implementation in TinyAD</h3>
            <p>
                To model the physical behavior of paper-like materials, we implemented all major constraints—stretching, shearing, and bending—directly within the TinyAD automatic differentiation framework. Each constraint is formulated as an energy term that penalizes deviations from the rest configuration, and TinyAD is used to automatically compute the required gradients and Hessians for the implicit solver.
            </p>
            <p>
                For each triangle, the <strong>stretching and shearing constraints</strong> are encoded as:
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                \[
                E_{\text{stretch/shear}}(\mathbf{x}) = -\frac{1}{2}k_{\text{stretch}} \|C_{\text{stretch}}(\mathbf{x})\|^2 - \frac{1}{2}k_{\text{shear}} C_{\text{shear}}(\mathbf{x})^2
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                where the constraint vectors are defined as:
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                \[
                C_{\text{stretch}}(\mathbf{x}) = A_{uv} \cdot ( \| \mathbf{w}_u \| - 1,\, \| \mathbf{w}_v \| - 1 )
                \]
                <br>
                \[
                C_{\text{shear}}(\mathbf{x}) = A_{uv} \cdot ( \mathbf{w}_u \cdot \mathbf{w}_v )
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                with \(\mathbf{w}_u\) and \(\mathbf{w}_v\) computed from the world-to-material transformation.
            </p>
            <p>
                For each pair of adjacent triangles, the <strong>bending constraint</strong> is encoded as:
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                \[
                E_{\text{bend}}(\mathbf{x}) = -\frac{1}{2}k_{\text{bend}} \cdot (\theta - \theta_0)^2 \cdot \frac{\ell}{h}
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                where \(\theta\) is the current dihedral angle, \(\theta_0\) is the rest angle, \(\ell\) is the length of the shared edge, and \(h\) is a normalization factor.
            </p>
            <p>
                To stabilize the simulation without overdamping, we implemented damping forces aligned with each deformation mode: stretch, shear, and bend. We compute damping as a function of the rate of change of each constraint condition,
                applying damping only in the directions that contribute to deformation. This avoids penalizing rigid-body motion and helps prevent oscillations in stiff materials like paper. The damping force d with a condition C is calculated as: 
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                \[
                \mathbf{d} = -k_d \frac{\partial C(x)}{\partial x} \cdot \dot{C}(x)
                \]
                </p>
            <p>
                By expressing all constraints as energy terms within TinyAD, we enable the system to automatically and efficiently compute the necessary derivatives for stable and accurate simulation, even with highly stiff materials.

            <h3>6. Switch to Semi-Implicit Euler Integration</h3>
            <p>
                To achieve stable simulation of highly stiff, paper-like materials, we replaced the explicit Verlet integration scheme with a semi-implicit (backward) Euler integrator. This approach, inspired by <i>Large Steps in Cloth Simulation</i>, allows for much larger time steps and higher constraint stiffness without numerical instability. In the semi-implicit Euler method, velocities are updated using the forces computed at the next (unknown) positions, and then positions are updated using these new velocities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The update equations for each time step are:
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                \[
                \mathbf{v}_{t+1} = \mathbf{v}_t + h \mathbf{M}^{-1} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}_{t+1}, \mathbf{v}_{t+1})
                \]
                <br>
                \[
                \mathbf{x}_{t+1} = \mathbf{x}_t + h \mathbf{v}_{t+1}
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                where:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>\(\mathbf{x}\)</strong> and <strong>\(\mathbf{v}\)</strong> are the positions and velocities,</li>
                <li><strong>\(h\)</strong> is the time step,</li>
                <li><strong>\(\mathbf{M}\)</strong> is the mass matrix,</li>
                <li><strong>\(\mathbf{f}\)</strong> is the force vector (the negative gradient of the total energy).</li>
            </ul>

                In practice, this requires solving a linear system at each time step, which incorporates both the gradient and Hessian of the energy function (computed via TinyAD). This implicit integration scheme is essential for simulating the sharp, stable folds and creases characteristic of paper, as it prevents the simulation from diverging even under very stiff constraints.

            <h3>7. Angle-Based Bending Constraints</h3>
            <p>
                To mimic the distinctive bending behavior of paper folding and creasing, we implemented a dihedral angle-based bending constraint system between adjacent triangles sharing an edge. This approach, inspired by discrete shell models, is more physically accurate than simple distance-based springs and is essential for capturing the rigidity and sharp folds characteristic of paper. By using significantly higher bending stiffness coefficients, our simulation resists unwanted flexing and allows for the formation of stable creases.
            </p>
            <p>
                For each internal edge, we compute the dihedral angle between the two adjacent triangles and penalize deviations from the rest angle, as described in our bending energy formulation (see Step 5). The resulting forces, computed automatically via TinyAD, ensure that the material maintains its structure while allowing for realistic folding behavior. This enables our simulation to reproduce the sharp, stable folds and overall rigidity observed in real paper.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>Additionally, we explored extending the bending constraint network to include "3-separated" vertices (commented in our code), which would provide additional rigidity for sharper folds. Though we didn't implement dynamic mesh modifications such as adaptive remeshing along fold lines, our approach effectively simulates folding behavior through the combination of high-stiffness stretch constraints and strategically placed bending forces between well-chosen vertex pairs.</p>

            <h3>8. Implementing Plastic Deformation</h3>
            <p>
                To further enhance the realism of our paper simulation, we introduced a simple model of plastic deformation for bending. In real paper, repeated folding or excessive bending can cause permanent creases, where the material no longer returns to its original flat state. To capture this effect, we allow the rest dihedral angle (\(\theta_0\)) between adjacent triangles to update when the bending exceeds a certain threshold.
            </p>
            <p>
                Specifically, during each simulation step, if the absolute difference between the current dihedral angle (\(\theta\)) and the rest angle (\(\theta_0\)) exceeds a plasticity threshold (\(\delta_\text{plastic}\)), we update the rest angle to partially "follow" the current angle:
            </p>
            <p class="formula">
                \[
                \theta_0 \leftarrow (1 - \alpha)\theta_0 + \alpha\theta
                \]
            </p>
            <p>
                where:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>\(\alpha\)</strong> is a small plasticity rate (e.g., 0.1),</li>
                <li>The update is only applied if \(|\theta - \theta_0| > \delta_\text{plastic}\).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This mechanism allows the simulated paper to develop permanent creases after repeated or extreme folding, closely mimicking the behavior of real paper. By combining this plasticity model with our high-stiffness constraints, our simulation can represent both the elastic and inelastic responses of paper during folding and manipulation.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Omission of Shear Constraints Led to Distortion</strong>
                    <p>Initially, we believed triangle meshes would resist shearing due to their angular rigidity. In practice, omitting shear constraints resulted in non-physical distortion. We corrected this by implementing triangle-local shear forces based on the deformation gradient.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Performance Challenges with High Stiffness</strong>
                    <p>Simulating paper realistically required very high stiffness values, especially for bending. This in turn made the solver slow, requiring hundreds of steps per frame. We addressed this using damping and experimented with reduced stiffness values to strike a balance between speed and realism.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unstable Folding Without Gradual Updates</strong>
                    <p>Sharp changes to bending rest angles caused the mesh to oscillate or break. Inspired by [2], we introduced time-based interpolation of rest angles to fold gradually, improving stability.</p>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Shear Forces Are Not Optional in Triangle Meshes</strong>
                    <p>Even with a well-structured mesh, realistic deformation requires explicit modeling of both stretching and shearing.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Implicit Integration Enables Realistic Stiffness</strong>
                    <p>While more computationally expensive, implicit methods allow for higher fidelity in simulating stiff materials like paper. The tradeoff between accuracy and performance must be tuned carefully.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Gradual Rest-State Modification Prevents Instability</strong>
                    <p>Trying to force a mesh into a folded state too quickly results in instability. Progressive rest-state updates are essential for simulating fold-like behavior.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Paper Simulation is Achievable Without Full Origami Modeling</strong>
                    <p>Although we did not implement interactive folding or edge remeshing, we achieved realistic folding effects through force-based simulation alone, showing that a simplified paper model can still produce meaningful visual results.</p>
